7 (Cafe staff) Customer number 34, one cafe latte is ready.
8 Customer number 35, one iced Americano is ready.
9 There’s no iced Americano.
10 (Cafe staff) Uh, it went out earlier.
11 Someone else must have taken it.
12 Customer number 34.
13 Customer number 34.
14 Ah, yes, that’s me.
15 Ah, where did my coffee go?
16 (Cafe staff) I’m sorry, I’ll make it quickly for you.
17
18
19  (Jiwon) If no one steals it,
20
21 the coffee stays.
22 But if someone takes it,
23 This isn’t a joke, what are you doing right now?
24 (Jiwon) There’s no coffee.
25
26 (Jiwon) Do I have to have my destiny stolen from me?
27
28
29 (Kyungwook) You know what a strike is, right? A strike?
30 I hit the ball once, bam! And it just goes...
31 Everyone just gets knocked out.
32 So, if you hit it hard, it just flies like a bowling ball.
33 It’s all gone.
34 But when I think about it...
35 Huh? Jiwon?
36
37 (Jiwon) If someone steals my destiny,
38 it’s probably you, right?
39 You have to take everything of mine to be satisfied.
40
41
42 Hurry up and come.
43
44
45 (JiHyuk) Oh, boss.
46
47 Hello.
48 (Kyungwook) Boss, were you out for a field visit?
49 Deputy Yang said you weren’t coming to work today.
50 (JiHyuk) Ah, yes.
51 Suddenly, something came up this morning.
52 (Kyungwook) Ah, I see.
53 Hey, Jiwon, are you working on that project properly?
54 If you mess up again, I won’t let it slide.
55 I’m working hard on it.
56 (Sumin) If you say it like that,
57 it sounds like I didn’t do my job properly.
58 Our Jiwon works so hard.
59
60 Is this the delicious coffee?
61 It’s the cafe near the bus stop, right?
62 (Kyungwook) This, this? Huh? You went out and bought coffee during work hours?
63 Sorry.
64 I was on a field visit and bought coffee on the way back.
65 (Kyungwook) Anyway, women don’t work.
66 They just eat delicious things.
67
68
69
70
71 - Manager Kang - Yes?
72 Just a moment.
73 Drink the coffee.
74 (Jiwon) Boss, would you like to drink this?
75 I haven’t even touched it yet.
76 Actually, I skipped breakfast today.
77 So I went out for the field visit...
78 (JiHyuk) You should always make sure to have breakfast.
79 (Jiwon) Ah...
80 (JiHyuk) Drink it.
81 I called you over so you wouldn’t feel awkward drinking coffee alone.
82 I wanted to make it comfortable for you.
83 Thank you.
84 Oh, by the way,
85 I’m not quitting my job.
86 Would you like to see this?
87  (Jiwon) This is from my dad.
88 Whenever my dad gives me pocket money,
89 he always draws a heart like this.
90 I told him not to doodle on the money,
91 but he couldn’t suppress his artistic spirit.
92 I’m the daughter who received this love from my dad.
93 I’ll do my best.
94
95 Also,
96 the fact that you said I’m a capable employee
97 really helped me stay focused. Thank you.
98 Actually, it’s been a while.
99 I’ve forgotten what I really want.
100 I’ve forgotten what I really want.
101 I’ve been just getting by day by day.
102 But from now on, I’m not going to live like that.
103 That’s a good thought.
104 Oh, you thought I’d smile?
105 I don’t think I’ve ever seen you smile before.
106
107 By any chance,
108 do you have any plans this weekend?
109 This weekend...
110 No.
111 - Then... - (Sumin) Jiwon has plans for the weekend.
112 I’ve already made a reservation.
113
114 What? You’ve already forgotten? How disappointing.
115 I’ve made a reservation at Goseuljeong, a really delicious BBQ place.
116 Goseuljeong?
117 Yes, do you know it?
118  I think I’ve heard of it.
119 Got it.
120 (Sumin) I’ll drink the coffee you’re drinking too.
121 Let’s go out together.
122 Sorry, I’m a little busy right now.
123 (Sumin) Why? I really want to drink it.
124 They say the sandwiches there are really good too.
125
126
127 Jiwon, you’re really no fun.
128 The boss tried to make me work even on the weekend, but I saved you,
129 and now you can’t even have one cup of coffee.
130 A goody-goody who just works all the time.
131 I really don’t like it.
132
133
134
135
136
137 Yes, Goseuljeong, right?
138 I’m just confirming a group reservation for this Sunday.
139 The Busan Taehago alumni meeting is at 6...
140 Oh, 5:30?
141
142 Oh, Dongseok.
143 Can you find one person for me?
144 (JiHyuk) Yeah, right now.
145
146 I’ll call you back later.
147 (Jiwon) Boss, this is for you.
148 It’s painkiller.
149 I heard it’s better to take it if you feel any pain.
150 Did Manager Kang take it?
151 It must hurt a lot since you’re injured.
152 Ah, I’m fine.
153 You’re good at being prepared, but you should take care of yourself first.
154 Right now, it's you, Manager Kang, who needs this more than me.
155
156 (JiHyuk) Thank you.
157
158
159 (Minhwan) Come out for a second.
160
161 (Jiwon) I have to let Sumin steal my fate.
162
163 (Minhwan) Hey, no way.
164 Did you really break up because of Yoo JiHyuk?
165 What?
166 (Minhwan) That guy Yoo JiHyuk, he’s young but a manager,
167 and I think he thinks he’s important because of that.
168 He’s this half-witted guy who doesn’t know anything.
169 A man should be judged by his looks and sense, right?
170 Huh?
171 What’s that expression?
172 Are you really with Yoo JiHyuk? Huh?
173 (Jiwon) Boss, I’m sorry.
174 Ah, so it’s because of the errand JiHyuk asked you to do earlier, right?
175 Did that guy ask you to buy the band?
176 What a crazy old man, seriously.
177 He made you do a personal errand when you’re injured?
178 (Minhwan) I can’t stand it.
179
180 (Jiwon) The reason I said I wanted to break up
181 is because I felt like our relationship wasn’t the same as before.
182 Ah, I don’t know, I don’t know.
183 I don’t want to talk about it.
184
185 What? What? Huh?
186 (Minhwan) Did you think I was upset because I thought I was losing interest?
187 (Jiwon) Yeah...
188 I want to have a relationship that others envy.
189 I want someone to want to take you away, Minhwan.
190 I want you to be a proud boyfriend.
191 What’s that?
192 (Minhwan) Ah, who cares what others think?
193 As long as we’re real with each other, it’s fine.
194
195 Kang Jiwon, this, this...
196 I thought you were just a sentimental fool, but you’re not, huh?
197 I got it.
198 I’ll pay more attention from now on, okay?
199 So let’s make up.
200 Let's make up.
201 - Make up - (Minhwan) Yeah.
202 (Jiwon) Huh.
203  Why, why, what?
204 (Minhwan) Let's make up.
205 (Jiwon) So why here, at the office?
206 It's okay, no one is coming.
207 - I said they are coming! - (Minhwan) No.
208  Ah, wait, hold on, phone, phone.
209 It's okay, it's my mom. It's time for her to take her medicine.
210 (Jiwon) This won't work.
211 (Jiwon) Ah...
212 (Minhwan) Ah, yes, well...
213 Let's make up, ah, okay.
214
215
216 (Juran) I, I...
217 I shouldn't get involved, but...
218 Even in a relationship,
219 it's not good to force physical contact when the other person doesn't want it.
220 Uh...
221 Ah, I just remembered the past.
222 I regret it a lot.
223 Jiwon, you're a smart person,
224 so don’t make the same choice as me.
225
226 (Jiwon) Did you come on purpose, thinking about me?
227 (Kyungwook) Okay, it's lunchtime.
228 Let's eat first, okay?
229 Deputy Yang,
230 Did you make a reservation for the eel soup?
231 (Minhwan) Honey, what should we eat?
232 (Sumin) I want curry today.
233 Let's go to the Indian curry place.
234 Sorry, I'm broke lately.
235 And today, the cafeteria has stir-fried pork.
236 (Jiwon) Oh, Minhwan, you should take Sumin and
237 eat curry for her.
238
239 No, if Jiwon wants stir-fried pork,
240 I'll go to the cafeteria today too.
241 Okay, then.
242 Let's go to the cafeteria.
243
244 (Sumin) Thank you, thank you, my other half.
245
246 Yeah.
247 (Jiwon) On days when things don't go your way,
248 I knew you'd act moody, but I didn’t mind.
249 (Sumin) Huh? Let's sit there.
250
251
252  (Min-hwan) Hey, come on, be more careful
253 Ji-won, are you okay?
254 (Su-min) Ji-won, are you okay? Ji-won
255 What should we do, what should we do
256 (Ji-won) I endured it
257 I thought you were the only one for me
258 - (Su-min) I'm sorry - You should've dodged, I can't believe I got hit again
259 (Su-min) What should we do
260
261 Hey, let's sit over there
262
263
264
265
266 (Min-hwan) Ah, damn...
267
268 Damn...
269 Damn
270 (Ji-won)  What should we do, I'm sorry, I'm sorry
271 Are you okay?
272  I'm sorry
273
274 (Ji-won) Su-min, I'm sorry
275 I tripped over my own foot, didn't I?
276
277  Honey
278 - Are you hurt anywhere? - (Min-hwan) Ugh, damn...
279 Oh, this is the shirt you cherished the most...
280
281 (Ji-won) Oh no...
282 It's all ruined
283 What should we do
284 Napkin, napkin
285 Ah, napkin, uh, uh
286 (Ji-won) I won’t let this happen again
287 (Hee-yeon) Excuse me
288 Are you the one outside?
289 (Ji-won) Me?
290 (Hee-yeon) Yes, yes, yes
291 Are you perhaps the...
292 Can I ask a favor?
293 Do you need a sanitary pad by any chance?
294 (Hee-yeon)  Yes, yes, yes, yes
295 Yes, yes
296 (Ji-won) Just a moment, I'll bring it to you
297 (Hee-yeon) Thank you, really, thank you.
298 Ah, I'm really so grateful.
299 I really wonder what kind of person I am.
300 I was going to treat you like a benefactor.
301 You were a close person after all.
302 I will make sure to treat you well.
303 Ah, treat you well? Of course, it's nothing.
304 Hee-yeon, just a moment.
305 (Ji-won) Excuse me.
306 As expected.
307
308
309
310 (Ji-won) Okay.
311 How can you be so virtuous?
312 someone who I thought no longer existed in this era.
313 The deputy manager is like the Good Samaritan
314 (Hee-yeon) The embodiment of our kind neighbor, who only existed in movies.
315 And truly, you are the light and salt of my life, a real benefactor.
316
317 Ah, is this your natural personality?
318 (Hee-yeon) Oh my.
319 No, you're really so beautiful when you smile.
320 Why didn't I realize this until now?
321 You have both beauty and kindness.
322 You must really be living life on your own.
323
324 (Ji-won) Ah, you're really overdoing it.
325 I'm sure others would have done the same.
326 Ah, absolutely not.
327 Ah, before the deputy manager came in, someone else entered.
328 I was calling out so desperately, you know?
329
3330 (Hee-yeon) Grumbling and swearing,
331 then taking care of business and washing hands thoroughly before leaving.
332
333 (Soo-min) Thank you, thank you, my other half.
334 (Ji-won) Ah...
335 (Hee-yeon) Did you have a meal?
336 I haven't eaten yet.
337 I came here unprepared to eat,
338 I found myself in a crisis.
339  Ah, that's right.
340 Now that I think about it, why haven't we had a meal together?
341
342 If it's okay with you, would you like to eat together?
343 (Soo-min) I was wondering why the person who went to get napkins hasn't come back.
344 I was wondering why they weren't coming back.
345 (Ji-won) Ah...
346 This side is also in an emergency situation.
347 What emergency?
348 (Soo-min) Well...
349 We handled it ourselves.
350 We took care of it well.
351 (Min-hwan) What's this?
352 (Ji-won) Park Min-hwan is going to be furious.
353 He begged me for a year to buy him that shirt.
354 (Soo-min) I’m really sorry, Deputy Manager Park.
355 I’ll buy you a shirt.
356 Ah, it's okay.
357 (Min-hwan) It’s just a shirt, nothing big.
358 Don’t worry about it.
359 (Hee-yeon) Isn’t this a designer brand?
360 Is it 1.5 million won, or is it 1.8 million won?
361
362 (Ji-won) It's not that much, maybe a little over 1.2 million won?
363 (Min-hwan) Well... (Soo-min) What should we do...
364 Since I'm a contract worker, I don’t have much money.
365
366 (Min-hwan) Ah, it's fine, don’t worry about it. Please eat.
367 Is it okay?
368 (Soo-min) As expected, Deputy Manager Park is capable.
369 - The best, the best - (Min-hwan) Soo-min, you too,
370 We should go buy a shirt together.
371 Eat, eat, eat. I have plenty of shirts at home.
372 Your heart is like the sea.
373 I was originally going to make stir-fried pork today.
374 Wow, it smells great, the scent of stir-fried pork.
375
376 (Soo-min) Deputy Manager Park is the best.
377
378 (Eun-ho) Always be careful with the fire.
379 Slice the onions a bit more.
380 Good, good, keep going.
381 Hey, it's burning.
382 If you leave it, it'll burn. Take a look again.
383
384 Thank you for coming.
385 (Guest) The food is really delicious.
386 (Eun-ho)  Yes.
387 Chef Baek Eun-ho.
388 (Eun-ho) Yes.
389 You’re from Busan, right?
390 Yes, so what?
391
392 (Min-hwan) Wow, Hee-yeon really eats well.
393 (Soo-min) True.
394 How can a woman eat so much?
395
396 Whether you're a woman or a man,
397 to do something big, you have to eat well.
398 (Hee-yeon) This is what my grandfather taught me.
399 (Soo-min) So? Did your grandfather do something big?
400 He sold bean sprouts.
401 Along with tofu and seasoning sauce.
402 Ah, he was in the side dish business.
403 Thanks to your grandfather, it seems like you have a lot of energy, Hee-yeon.
404 (Ji-won) Koreans' strength comes from rice, after all.
405 That's right, that's correct.
406 (Soo-min) Ah...
407 I have a small appetite, so it’s a big problem.
408 Ah, Soo-min, how are you going to work after eating that?
409 Soo-min, you can't eat much.
410 (Soo-min) True.
411 I should eat like Ji-won does.
412  Now that I think about it, our Ji-won,
413 has never had any problems with indigestion since she was young.
414 She had digestion power strong enough to chew through steel.
415 - Right, Ji-won? - (Ji-won) Yeah.
416 (Min-hwan) Ah, really?
417 Now that I think about it, I remember when we used to have pig's feet soup back in the day.
418 You're totally an old man, an old man.
419 The roughness, ugh...
420 Old man.
421
422 Min-hwan, you shouldn't say that.
423 Our Ji-won should be loved unconditionally.
424 Love
425 (Min-hwan) Ah, that's right, love is important.
426 It must be nice to have a friend like that, huh?
427
428 (Ji-won) Soo-min is like that, the best.
429 Why is it that men...
430 (Hee-yeon) Manager, I'll get you some water.
431 - Mine too, please. - Huh? Why me?
432 You're going to get water anyway.
433 - Ah, while I'm at it, mine too... - Anyway, Jeong Soo-min, who came to work at the company,
434 Could you do my work for me as well?
435
436 (Soo-min) Me, me...
437 Me, me, me...
438 (Soo-min) Why is she acting like that, she’s so young, right?
439 Don’t do that.
440
441 It’s a company, after all.
442 You may be young, but your rank is the same as mine.
443 (Soo-min) Huh?
444 (Ji-won) Ah...
445 Still, I’ll try to talk to her properly.
446 (Min-hwan) Yeah, yeah, right? Talk to her for me, okay?
447 What kind of upbringing did she have, wrapping her manners up in seasoning sauce?
448 (Ji-won) Min-hwan, feed Soo-min and go up first.
449 You know she has a small appetite.
450 If you don’t take care of her, she won’t eat properly.
451 I’m so different from her.
452 Yeah, well...
453 (Ji-won) I’ll go up.
454 (Ji-won) Hee-yeon, I’m sorry.
455 I cleared the trays, it must have been really uncomfortable, right?
456 Ah, I’m sorry, I should have held back.
457
458 I totally understood.
459 (Hee-yeon) The person who ignored me in the bathroom earlier,
460 is Jeong Soo-min.
461
462 (Hee-yeon) Oh, excuse me, the person who just came in,
463 Could you possibly help me?
464 She’s unprepared herself, why does she want to ask others to help?
465 (Soo-min)  I cause so much trouble.
466 (Hee-yeon) Manager, would you like to go for coffee after our meeting?
467 - I’ll pay - (Ji-won) I said I’ll pay.
468 It seems Ji-won is upset.
469 I ruined the manager's shirt.
470 (Min-hwan) Oh, come on...
471 You know Ji-won’s not like that.
472 Earlier, she was even worried about Soo-min eating.
473 You know how much she cares, right?
474 (Soo-min) Really?
475
476 Ji-won can sometimes be too careless.
477 She doesn’t even know how much I like her.
478 (Min-hwan) Oh...
479 Even if she says it’s fine...
480
481 (Employee 1) Let’s go. (Employee 2) Let’s go.
482
483 (Min-hwan) Oh dear
484 (Soo-min) Ah...
485
486 Oh, my hand...
487 (Min-hwan) Ah, ah, yes...
488
489
490
491 (Soo-min) This...
492 What should we do?
493 (Min-hwan) Well, uh...
494
495 (Min-hwan) No, no, no, no, no, uh...
496 (Employee 3) We’ll go in now. (Employee 4) Hey, don’t push.
497 Don’t push, don’t push.
498
499
500 (Soo-min) Perfume,
501 What kind do you use?
502
503 (Min-hwan) Ah, this... yeah...
504
505 It smells nice.
506 Yeah, well...
507
508 (Min-hwan) Uh, uh...
509 (Ji-won) Thanks.
510 (Kyung-wook) Uh-huh.
511 Hey, what are you doing right now?
512 (Hee-yeon) Huh?
513 (Juran) Ah, here’s the meeting materials, Manager.
514
515 (Kyung-wook) Hey, didn’t I tell you not to do this?
516 Huh?
517  Honestly, let me tell you,
518 The proposal you wrote is so obvious,
519 But if there’s even a small effort put into it,
520 The atmosphere of this meeting will be better!
521 Do you really think this makes sense?
522 - Huh? - (Ji-won) When a person is incompetent,
523 they focus on the little things they know and make a lot of noise about it.
524 (Soo-min) Ah, that looks unprofessional.
525 Hee-yeon, where’s the stapler?
526 Like this
527 At an angle.
528 The stapler?
529 (Kyung-wook) Right, huh?
530 Wow, Soo-min knows a thing or two.
531
532 Just redo everything and staple it again.
533
534 (Juran) Do all of these?
535 (Hee-yeon) We’re going to waste so much paper.
536 Do you realize how many trees were used unnecessarily because of you?
537 It’s meant to make you feel guilty.
538 (Soo-min) Manager,
539 Juran, I’m sure you understand too.
540 Ji-won, can I have just one coffee with you?
541 Manager,
542 Can you just take a look at this proposal once?
543 I need to become a full-time employee, you know?
544 Should I go out and get some fresh air?
545 Should we?
546
547 I’m sorry, Manager.
548 I just didn’t know and stapled them straight.
549  No, no.
550 It’s okay.
551
552 (Ji-won) This definitely won’t do.
553 Assistant Manager Yang.
554 (Ji-won) Would you like to have a coffee with me?
555 (Joo-ran) Uh...
556 I have something the Manager asked me to do.
557 It’ll only take a moment.
558 (Joo-ran) Uh...
559 You're acting a bit strange.
560 (Joo-ran) Alright, next time, next time.
561 Ah, then at least look at this.
562 (Joo-ran) One-person household.
563 Isn't this the proposal the Manager rejected?
564 Ugh, what good would it do for me to look at this?
565 (Ji-won) Please read it properly.
566 If you really don't have time, then I can't do much about it.
567 Then.
568 (Joo-ran) Ah...
569
570 (Ji-won)  You scared me!
571 Where did you run off to like that?
572 (Ji-won) Ah, well...
573 The meeting’s over, so I’m going to the bathroom and then...
574 (Ji-won) Let’s sneak away to the lounge for a bit.
575 (Ji-won) Ah...
576 (Ji-won) Oh, I was going to talk to Min-hwan, so...
577 You can go later.
578
579
580
581
582
583
584 (Ji-won) Hye-yeon, I have to go to the office for something.
585 (Ji-won) I think I’ll need to go upstairs.
586 (Hye-yeon) Then do I eat all of this by myself?
587
588 What should I do, I keep receiving all the time like this?
589 Then, would you go on a date with me this Sunday instead?
590 I’ll treat you to a meal.
591 Sunday?
592 (Soo-min) Instead, let’s go on a date this weekend.
593 I know a really delicious barbecue place called 'Gosuljeong.'
594 Ah, I don’t think I can on Sunday.
595 Do you have plans?
596 I do have plans,
597 but I don’t think I’ll go.
598 Ah, is it okay if I don’t go?
599 (Hee-yeon) What kind of plans do you have?
600 A reunion.
601 (Hee-yeon) If it’s a reunion, you should go.
602 You’ll see your first love,
603 get disappointed,
604 and then move on.
605 I wonder where my first love is and what they’re doing now.
606 No one knows where they are.
607 I was actually a pretty unpopular student.
608 Do I really have to go all the way there to confirm my embarrassing past?
609 (Hee-yeon) Doesn’t that mean you should go even more?
610  If you don’t go, it’ll just stay as an embarrassing past,
611 but if you go and change it, it’ll become history.
612 (Ji-Won) Ah, Manager
613 (Ji-Hyuk) Yes
614 (Ji-Won) About you asking if I’m free on Sunday
615 If it’s urgent, I’ll come to work
616 Didn’t you have plans?
617 Well, yes, but
618 It’s not important, and work comes first
619 That seems right
620 Kang Ji-Won comes first
621
622 (Ji-Won) Ah, well
623 Actually, I’m debating whether to go or not
624 Go
625 When you’re unsure, the right answer depends on the situation
626 But this time, give it a try
627 It should be fine if you go
628 Just remember you owe me one
629 Huh?
630 (Ji-Won) Read it properly
631 But if you really don’t have time, it can’t be helped
632 (Ju-Ran) It’s well written
633 (Ji-Won) Assistant Yang
634 Did you read it?
635 (Ju-Ran) Yeah
636 The proposal looks good
637 That’s pretty good
638 Would you like to try working on it together?
639 (Ju-Ran) Ah...
640 Work doesn’t always work like that
641 The manager sees things differently from us...
642 He didn’t even read it, that guy
643 - What? - I read it
644
645 He pretended to flip through it
646 He was just acting like he was reading
647 (Ji-Won) This isn’t the first time
648 He nitpicks every single thing of yours
649 Just “No, no, no” all the time
650
651 (Kyung-Wook) That’s nothing new
652
653 (Employee 5) Look at the manager, he’s causing a scene
654 (Ji-Won) He thinks that’s what power is
655 It’s ridiculous
656 (Ji-Won) If you’ve been gaslighted for too long, you lose objectivity
657 Just setting everything else aside
658 Forget about the manager’s perspective or anything
659 What’s your opinion?
660 Do you really think my proposal is nonsense? Really?
661
662 Then I’ll try discussing it with the manager
663 Manager Kim Kyung-Wook
664
665
666
667 (Su-Min) That girl has been really annoying me lately
668 (Kyung-Wook, Su-Min) Oh, you startled me!
669 (Su-Min) Oh, Manager
670 Did you enjoy your lunch?
671 (Kyung-Wook) Our lovely Su-Min, huh?
672 I had some loach soup to energize myself
673
674 Oh, what about you, Su-Min?
675 (Su-Min) Ah, I had stir-fried pork at the cafeteria
676 (Kyung-Wook) Wow, that must’ve been delicious
677
678 (Su-Min) Um...
679 I have a little secret to share with you, Manager
680 (Kyung-Wook) A secret?
681 I need to become a permanent employee, right?
682 (Su-Min) So, I’ve thought of something, but
683 I can’t quite organize my thoughts
684 (Kyung-Wook) Ah, I’ll help you organize them
685 Really?
686 Thank you so much
687 (Kyung-Wook) Oh, come on
688 With just a middle-aged lady who doesn’t even act like a woman and a bunch of nobodies,
689 For the sake of improving this uninspired team atmosphere,
690 Su-Min’s permanent employment is an urgent matter
691
692  (Su-Min) Manager, you’re so...
693 Funny and charming
694 (Ji-Won) You know how he always works however he feels like
695 That’s why he automatically opposes everything you say
696 Ever since he got rejected after making a move on you back in the day
697
698 What is he saying? So childish
699 (Ji-Won) He’s been repeating that childish behavior for 7 years, Kim Kyung-Wook has
700 The only reason he could become a manager
701 Was because he submitted your proposal under his name
702 I know that
703 (Ji-Won) Just like always,
704 He used my proposal to make Jung Su-Min a permanent employee
705 He was my mentor
706 In this company, the work done by subordinates
707 Always gets credited to their superiors...
708 (Ji-Won) But you’ve never done that
709 I’m really confident about this proposal
710 And you know it’s a good one too
711
712 But the manager...
713 I’ll resubmit the same proposal that got rejected on Monday
714 Without even changing the title
715 Huh?
716 If it becomes clear that he rejected it without reading,
717 Then,
718 Will you stand with me?
719 (Ji-Won) There’s a 100% chance he didn’t read it
720 No, maybe 99%?
721 I’m certain Kim Kyung-Wook doesn’t read proposals
722 But if he remembers even one chart or figure...
723 Don’t be scared, I’m right
724
725 Believe in how lazy and unproductive that man is
726
727
728 (Ji-Won) Manager, please review this
729 It’s a new proposal
730
731
732
733 Are you messing with me right now?
734 This is the same thing you gave me last time...
735
736 (Kyung-Wook) Wow, I’m absolutely speechless...
737 This is... the same thing from last time...
738 And it’s even worse!
739
740 I mean, seriously?
741 I’ve seen plenty of incompetent people in my life,
742 But you’re the first of your kind
743 How could you mess up this badly?
744 It’s so obvious you just patched this together from here and there
745 If you don’t want to work, just quit
746 Why are you torturing me like this?
747 I’m really sorry, Manager
748 Was it the same as last time?
749 (Ji-Won) I printed it again, just a moment
750 Oh, here it is, the green one
751 I’m so sorry, Manager. I apologize
752 (Employee 6) What? He couldn’t recognize something he’s already seen?
753 (Employee 7) Wow, he really doesn’t work at all
754 (Employee 6) Ah, as expected, living up to his reputation
755
756
757
758 I seriously thought, "No way, no way..."
759 But how does he seriously not notice?
760 The title is exactly the same. How can this happen?
761 I told you he doesn’t work
762 Now we’re all in the same team
763 Meal kits are going to be a huge hit
764 (Ji-Won) Quick and easy, delivering delicious meals to customers
765
766 (Ju-Ran) Alright
767 Now I understand why things haven’t been working out
768 I finally get it
769 Wow, seriously...
770 I can’t believe I’ve been trusting someone like this all along
771
772 (Hee-Yeon) Are you two having coffee by yourselves?
773 Cheers
774 (Hee-Yeon) Manager, this is incredible. How could you not know that?
775
776 (Su-Min) Meal kits for single-person households
777 (Su-Min) Cheers
778 (Kyung-Wook) What’s this? A date request after work?
779
780 (Su-Min) Because of that secret I mentioned earlier today
781 (Kyung-Wook) That word "secret"...
782 It’s so exciting
783
784 Samgyeopsal (grilled pork belly) sounds good, right? Yeah?
785 Oh, wait
786 You said you had stir-fried pork for lunch earlier, didn’t you?
787 Oh, this is two pork dishes in a row
788 That might be a bit much, huh?
789 Not at all
790 I actually prefer Korean pork over Korean beef
791 You’ve got good taste, huh?
792 (Kyung-Wook) As expected, our Su-Min is such an amazing woman
793 Oh, please
794 (Su-Min) The real amazing woman is Ji-Won
795
796 (Kyung-Wook) Ji-Won this, Ji-Won that
797 Do you really like her that much?
798 Women are impossible to understand.
799 Ji-Won, though...
800 (Su-Min) She’s a bit different from us. She went to Korea University.
801 She’s smart.
802 And...
803 She’s also pretty ambitious.
804 (Kyung-Wook) Korea University? What’s so great about that?
805 People from there just study all the time and end up being useless.
806 Their proposals are always full of unrealistic, pie-in-the-sky nonsense.
807 But Ji-Won probably doesn’t think that way, right?
808 She probably thinks you’re "clueless" or "lack vision."
809 That’s what she’d think, don’t you agree?
810
811 Are you saying I lack vision?
812 Oh, Su-Min, do you have a bit of a complex about your education?
813 (Kyung-Wook) Don’t be like that, okay?
814 College?
815 It’s totally useless.
816 I mean...
817 Ideas can be good, sure. That’s the point, right?
818 (Ji-won) Execution is separate, but
819 Anyway, Kang Ji-won,
820 (Kyung-wook) I always thought you were stiff,
821 turns out you're the type to think like that behind the scenes, huh?
822 Still, about that meal kit proposal you said was messed up earlier today,
823
824 It’s a mess, but the idea is good.
825 If the manager brings it over
826 and works on it with me,
827
828 it might actually be a big hit, don’t you think?
829 (Kyung-wook) With Sumin
830 - together? - Yes.
831
832 Anyway, if Ji-won works on it, it’s just going to derail,
833 but with your experience, Manager, if you steer it right,
834 I feel like I might actually become a full-time employee.
835
836 (Sumin) I guess I must feel really comfortable with you, Manager.
837 I can even chat about work like I do with my brother.
838
839 (Kyung-wook) Did you just call me
840 oppa (brother)?
841
842
843 (Kyung-wook) Oh, of course, of course, uh,
844 well, in private, I’m oppa, yeah.
845
846 Now,
847 come on, our Sumin,
848 tell this oppa more about the proposal.
849  First,
850 (Sumin) Let’s toast again, though.
851 (Kyung-wook)  Cheers!
852
853
854 Manager oppa, eat some meat, eat some meat.
855 (Sang-jong) Oh, nice shot.
856
857 (Min-hwan) Why does it have to be Kang Ji-won’s friend?
858 He doesn’t even let me try anything.
859 (Sang-jong) Hey, hey, what does it matter?
860 From the looks of it, she’s into you too, so just make a cool trade.
861 A cool trade, seriously.
862 (Min-hwan) What is this, a secondhand deal?
863 This isn’t some psycho messing around, seriously.
864 (Woman 1) Strike, right?
865 (Woman 2) Wow, amazing.
866
867 (Min-hwan) Nice shot!
868 Nice shot!
869
870 Sang-jong,
871 you don’t have any good girls on your radar? Huh?
872 I’m going crazy, seriously.
873 (Sang-jong) Crazy...
874 Wow, it’s Friday, and you’re still so energetic.
875 What about your girlfriend?
876 Why bring her up and kill my vibe?
877 Oh, she’s just for marriage.
878
879 Just for marriage?
880 Look,
881 she’s kind, frugal,
882 takes care of her parents well,
883 and she works hard but doesn’t know how to spend money.
884 - What do you think? - (Sang-jong) Oh,
885 sounds like the perfect wife material.
886 Perfectly boring, though.
887 (Min-hwan) She reads company prospect reports for fun, I’m telling you.
888 Have you ever met someone like that?
889 She’s probably looking at documents at work right now,
890 like this.
891
892 (Ji-won) Starting over means you can do anything.
893 It’s small, but I got back at Jung Su-min,
894 and Kim Kyung-wook, too.
895 You can do anything.
896
897 (Su-min) It’s a couple item.
898  Wear it when we meet on Sunday.
899 Your eternal love, Su-min.
900 Did you see the earrings she wore?
901
902 (Su-min)
903
904 Ko Seol-jeong.
905 It’s certain.
906
907
908
909
910 (Ye-ji) She’s really not coming, is she?
911 (Su-min) Ji-won-ah,
912 Ji-won, are you here? Are you here?
913 Come on in, let’s go.
914 (Ji-won) What is this?
915 Weren’t you two eating together?
916 (Su-min) If I said it was a reunion, you wouldn’t have come.
917 We’re over thirty now.
918 Let’s forget the past.
919 You know they’re all good friends, right?
920 - Let’s go. - (Ji-won) Su... Su-min, I...
921 (Su-min) It’s okay.
922 (Ji-won)
923 (Ye-ji) Kang Ji-won, seriously impressive.
924 Where does she think she has a close enough friend to come here?
925 (Friend 1) Maybe she came to eat some meat.
926 From the look of it, she must not eat well on her own.
927 (Ye-ji) Why are you suddenly speaking in Seoul dialect? Creepy.
928 (Friend 2) But still, how does she stick to Su-min like that?
929 (Ye-ji) Isn’t it obvious?
930 Su-min, that softie,
931 probably thinks being nice is the best policy, that’s why.
932 Without Su-min, she wouldn’t even be able to eat meat.
933
934 Drink some milk.
935
936 Stop it.
937
938 Our Jung Su-min is too nice, it’s really a problem.
939 (Ye-ji) We should take care of her ourselves.
940 Did you see those earrings she wore?
941 Looks like she copied Su-min’s.
942 Even from 500 meters away, it’s obviously fake, isn’t it?
943 Kang Ji-won has been clinging to Su-min since high school...
944 (Friend 2) Ye-ji, wait a second.
945 (Ye-ji) Huh?
946 (Friend 2) Kang Ji-won wasn’t at her seat earlier.
947
948
949
950
951 (Ye-ji) What, she was here?
952
953 Why is she pretending not to be here?
954 Wow...
955 That girl is seriously sneaky!
956
957 Are you crazy? Why would I go there?
958 (Ji-won)
959
960 (Su-min)
961
962 Do they think my house is some kind of motel?
963 (Ji-won) The two of them...
964 Wait a second.
965
966 Yeah.
967 Why wait for what’s bound to happen?
968 Their undying love for each other,
969 I’ll help make it happen faster.
970 Assistant Manager Kang, let’s head this way.
971 (Ji-won) Thank you.
972
973 (Ji-hyuk) Are you leaving work now?
974 (Ji-won) Yes, are you just coming in, Manager?
975 I had some things to organize.
976 Good work today. I’ll be on my way then...
977 (Ji-hyuk) Oh, wait.
978 (Ji-won) This?
979 I got it as a gift.
980 (Ji-hyuk) That...
981 There’s an authentic one of those.
982 Someone who knows will recognize it.
983
984
985 That...
986 There’s an authentic one of those.
987 Someone who knows will recognize it.
988 I mean...
989 I think...
990 You probably shouldn’t use it.
991 You probably shouldn’t use it.
992 (Ji-won) I remember now.
993 You said something similar before, and I thought it was rude.
994 Back then, I didn’t know what I’d face at the reunion.
995 It’s a gift from a friend,
996 but I thought you were just saying something negative.
997 I’m sorry.
998 Actually, no.
999 Thank you.
1000 Do you need a ride?
1001 What?
1002 Oh, since it’s late.
1003 No, it’s fine.
1004 The bus is still running, and I’ll get home quickly.
1005 I’d like to give you a ride.
1006 I’ll have to decline.
1007 I have plans with my boyfriend.
1008 (Ji-won) Then, I’ll be going.
1009 (Min-hwan) Thank you. Keep the change.
1010  What’s this?
1011 You’re running over here right after overtime?
1012 Well, he’s human too, he must be starving.
1013 This is chaos, absolute chaos.
1014 Kang Ji-won, you’re done for today.
1015
1016 If I drink this, I’ll get totally wasted, right?
1017
1018 (Su-min)
1019
1020
1021
1022 (Su-min) Ugh...
1023 "Hurry up and come"?
1024 No emoticons, just coldly...
1025 This is really too much.
1026 I'm not going.
1027 I'm not going!
1028
1029 (Min-hwan) ♪ You turn my heart upside down,
1030 Upside down, upside down ♪
1031 Roar!
1032
1033 Ji-won, you're done for today.
1034 (Ji-won) Why did you come so quickly?
1035
1036 (Su-min) I'm not going, I'm upset, I’m going home, hmph.
1037 I'm a little hurt.
1038 What’s this? Why aren’t you coming?
1039
1040
1041
1042
1043 Did you come?
1044
1045 You came quickly.
1046 I thought it would take longer.
1047 I came to spend the night with you.
1048 I took a taxi to get here.
1049
1050 Really?
1051 (Min-hwan) It's been
1052 so long.
1053 It's been a while.
1054 Right?
1055
1056 Yeah, it’s really been a while.
1057 (Ji-won) So, about that… can we talk—
1058 (Min-hwan) We should talk.
1059 Talk with our bodies.
1060 Maybe we should, uh, get dressed first...
1061 (Min-hwan) Shh!
1062 Right now,
1063 for us,
1064 clothes
1065 are unnecessary.
1066
1067 (Min-hwan) Come here.
1068 Stay right there.
1069
1070
1071
