Do not include segments that are boring, such as those with only background music, monologues, or descriptive scenes.
Include additional segments that are necessary for understanding specific scenes.
Do not respond if no matching segments exist.
Ensure the selection of segments aligns with the criteria of excitement and key events.
Follow the example format precisely when answering.
