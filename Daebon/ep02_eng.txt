6 [calling bell sound] 
7 (Cafe staff) Customer number 34, one cafe latte is ready. 
8 Customer number 35, one iced Americano is ready. 
9 There’s no iced Americano. 
10 (Cafe staff) Uh, it went out earlier. 
11 Someone else must have taken it. 
12 Customer number 34. 
13 Customer number 34. 
14 Ah, yes, that’s me. 
15 Ah, where did my coffee go? 
16 (Cafe staff) I’m sorry, I’ll make it quickly for you. 
17 [approaching footsteps] 
18 [tense music] 
19 [calm music] (Jiwon) If no one steals it, 
20 [sped-up sound effect] 
21 the coffee stays. 
22 But if someone takes it, 
23 This isn’t a joke, what are you doing right now? 
24 (Jiwon) There’s no coffee. 
25 [loud footsteps] 
26 (Jiwon) Do I have to have my destiny stolen from me? 
27 [meaningful sound effect] 
28 [broken sound effect] 
29 (Kyungwook) You know what a strike is, right? A strike? 
30 I hit the ball once, bam! And it just goes... 
31 Everyone just gets knocked out. [Kyungwook’s laughter] 
32 So, if you hit it hard, it just flies like a bowling ball. 
33 It’s all gone. [Kyungwook’s laughter] 
34 But when I think about it... 
35 Huh? Jiwon? 
36 [meaningful music] 
37 (Jiwon) If someone steals my destiny, 
38 it’s probably you, right? 
39 You have to take everything of mine to be satisfied. 
40 [elevator arrival sound] 
41 [Kyungwook’s faint sigh] 
42 Hurry up and come. 
43 [card key recognition sound] 
44 [bang] [intriguing sound effect] 
45 (JiHyuk) Oh, boss. 
46 [intriguing music] 
47 Hello. 
48 (Kyungwook) Boss, were you out for a field visit? 
49 Deputy Yang said you weren’t coming to work today. 
50 (JiHyuk) Ah, yes.
51 Suddenly, something came up this morning. 
52 (Kyungwook) Ah, I see. 
53 Hey, Jiwon, are you working on that project properly? 
54 If you mess up again, I won’t let it slide. 
55 I’m working hard on it. 
56 (Sumin) If you say it like that, 
57 it sounds like I didn’t do my job properly. 
58 Our Jiwon works so hard. 
59 [Sumin’s surprised breath] 
60 Is this the delicious coffee? 
61 It’s the cafe near the bus stop, right? 
62 (Kyungwook) This, this? Huh? You went out and bought coffee during work hours? 
63 Sorry. 
64 I was on a field visit and bought coffee on the way back. 
65 (Kyungwook) Anyway, women don’t work. 
66 They just eat delicious things. 
67 [bang] 
68 [intriguing music] 
69 [elevator arrival sound] 
70 [Kyungwook’s awkward breath] 
71 - Manager Kang - Yes? 
72 Just a moment. 
73 Drink the coffee. 
74 (Jiwon) Boss, would you like to drink this? 
75 I haven’t even touched it yet. 
76 Actually, I skipped breakfast today. 
77 So I went out for the field visit... 
78 (JiHyuk) You should always make sure to have breakfast. 
79 (Jiwon) Ah... 
80 (JiHyuk) Drink it. 
81 I called you over so you wouldn’t feel awkward drinking coffee alone. 
82 I wanted to make it comfortable for you. 
83 Thank you. 
84 Oh, by the way, 
85 I’m not quitting my job. 
86 Would you like to see this? 
87 [meaningful music] (Jiwon) This is from my dad. 
88 Whenever my dad gives me pocket money, 
89 he always draws a heart like this. 
90 I told him not to doodle on the money, 
91 but he couldn’t suppress his artistic spirit. 
92 I’m the daughter who received this love from my dad. 
93 I’ll do my best. 
94 [calm music] 
95 Also, 
96 the fact that you said I’m a capable employee 
97 really helped me stay focused. Thank you. 
98 Actually, it’s been a while. 
99 I’ve forgotten what I really want.
100 I’ve forgotten what I really want. 
101 I’ve been just getting by day by day. 
102 But from now on, I’m not going to live like that. 
103 That’s a good thought. 
104 Oh, you thought I’d smile? 
105 I don’t think I’ve ever seen you smile before. 
106 [soft laugh] 
107 By any chance, 
108 do you have any plans this weekend? 
109 This weekend... 
110 No. 
111 - Then... - (Sumin) Jiwon has plans for the weekend. 
112 I’ve already made a reservation. 
113 [approaching footsteps] 
114 What? You’ve already forgotten? How disappointing. 
115 I’ve made a reservation at Goseuljeong, a really delicious BBQ place. 
116 Goseuljeong? 
117 Yes, do you know it? 
118 [meaningful music] I think I’ve heard of it. 
119 Got it. 
120 (Sumin) I’ll drink the coffee you’re drinking too. 
121 Let’s go out together. 
122 Sorry, I’m a little busy right now. 
123 (Sumin) Why? I really want to drink it. 
124 They say the sandwiches there are really good too. 
125 [tense music] 
126 [sigh] 
127 Jiwon, you’re really no fun. 
128 The boss tried to make me work even on the weekend, but I saved you, 
129 and now you can’t even have one cup of coffee. 
130 A goody-goody who just works all the time. 
131 I really don’t like it. 
132 [sigh] 
133 [meaningful music] 
134 [keyboard typing sound] 
135 [mouse click sound] 
136 [call connecting sound] 
137 Yes, Goseuljeong, right? 
138 I’m just confirming a group reservation for this Sunday. 
139 The Busan Taehago alumni meeting is at 6... 
140 Oh, 5:30? 
141 [call connecting sound] 
142 Oh, Dongseok. 
143 Can you find one person for me? 
144 (JiHyuk) Yeah, right now. 
145 [knocking sound] 
146 I’ll call you back later. 
147 (Jiwon) Boss, this is for you. 
148 It’s painkiller. 
149 I heard it’s better to take it if you feel any pain. 
150 Did Manager Kang take it? 
151 It must hurt a lot since you’re injured. 
152 Ah, I’m fine. 
153 You’re good at being prepared, but you should take care of yourself first. 
154 Right now, it's you, Manager Kang, who needs this more than me. 
155 [calm music] 
156 (JiHyuk) Thank you. 
157 [pen dropping sound] 
158 [messenger receiving sound] 
159 (Minhwan) Come out for a second. 
160 [exciting music] 
161 (Jiwon) I have to let Sumin steal my fate. 
162 [door closing sound] 
163 (Minhwan) Hey, no way. 
164 Did you really break up because of Yoo JiHyuk? 
165 What? 
166 (Minhwan) That guy Yoo JiHyuk, he’s young but a manager, 
167 and I think he thinks he’s important because of that. 
168 He’s this half-witted guy who doesn’t know anything. 
169 A man should be judged by his looks and sense, right? 
170 Huh? [soft sigh] 
171 What’s that expression? 
172 Are you really with Yoo JiHyuk? Huh? 
173 (Jiwon) Boss, I’m sorry. 
174 Ah, so it’s because of the errand JiHyuk asked you to do earlier, right? 
175 Did that guy ask you to buy the band? 
176 What a crazy old man, seriously. 
177 He made you do a personal errand when you’re injured? 
178 (Minhwan) I can’t stand it. 
179 [Jiwon’s embarrassed breath] 
180 (Jiwon) The reason I said I wanted to break up 
181 is because I felt like our relationship wasn’t the same as before. 
182 Ah, I don’t know, I don’t know. [Jiwon’s awkward laugh] 
183 I don’t want to talk about it. 
184 [exciting music] 
185 What? What? Huh? 
186 (Minhwan) Did you think I was upset because I thought I was losing interest? 
187 (Jiwon) Yeah... 
188 I want to have a relationship that others envy. 
189 I want someone to want to take you away, Minhwan. 
190 I want you to be a proud boyfriend. 
191 What’s that? 
192 (Minhwan) Ah, who cares what others think? 
193 As long as we’re real with each other, it’s fine. 
194 [Minhwan’s soft laugh] 
195 Kang Jiwon, this, this... 
196 I thought you were just a sentimental fool, but you’re not, huh? 
197 I got it. 
198 I’ll pay more attention from now on, okay? 
199 So let’s make up.
200 Let's make up.
201 - Make up - (Minhwan) Yeah.
202 (Jiwon) Huh.
203 [Tense music] Why, why, what?
204 (Minhwan) Let's make up.
205 (Jiwon) So why here, at the office?
206 It's okay, no one is coming.
207 - I said they are coming! - (Minhwan) No.
208 [Cell phone ringtone] Ah, wait, hold on, phone, phone.
209 It's okay, it's my mom. It's time for her to take her medicine.
210 (Jiwon) This won't work.
211 (Jiwon) Ah...
212 (Minhwan) Ah, yes, well...
213 Let's make up, ah, okay.
214 [Running footsteps]
215 [A faint sigh]
216 (Juran) I, I...
217 I shouldn't get involved, but...
218 Even in a relationship,
219 it's not good to force physical contact when the other person doesn't want it.
220 Uh...
221 Ah, I just remembered the past.
222 I regret it a lot.
223 Jiwon, you're a smart person,
224 so don’t make the same choice as me.
225 [Heavy music]
226 (Jiwon) Did you come on purpose, thinking about me?
227 (Kyungwook) Okay, it's lunchtime.
228 Let's eat first, okay?
229 Deputy Yang,
230 Did you make a reservation for the eel soup?
231 (Minhwan) Honey, what should we eat?
232 (Sumin) I want curry today.
233 Let's go to the Indian curry place.
234 Sorry, I'm broke lately.
235 And today, the cafeteria has stir-fried pork.
236 (Jiwon) Oh, Minhwan, you should take Sumin and
237 eat curry for her.
238 [Dark music]
239 No, if Jiwon wants stir-fried pork,
240 I'll go to the cafeteria today too.
241 Okay, then.
242 Let's go to the cafeteria.
243 [Footsteps fading] [A faint sigh]
244 (Sumin) Thank you, thank you, my other half.
245 [Dark music]
246 Yeah.
247 (Jiwon) On days when things don't go your way,
248 I knew you'd act moody, but I didn’t mind.
249 (Sumin) Huh? Let's sit there.
250 [Bumps shoulders lightly]
251 [sound of employees gasping]
252 [Ji-won's faint groan] (Min-hwan) Hey, come on, be more careful
253 Ji-won, are you okay?
254 (Su-min) Ji-won, are you okay? Ji-won
255 What should we do, what should we do
256 (Ji-won) I endured it
257 I thought you were the only one for me
258 - (Su-min) I'm sorry - You should've dodged, I can't believe I got hit again
259 (Su-min) What should we do
260 [meaningful sound effect] [exciting music]
261 Hey, let's sit over there
262 [Su-min's scream stretching out]
263 [Su-min's scream stretching out]
264 [Min-hwan's scream stretching out]
265 [thud] [sound of employees gasping]
266 (Min-hwan) Ah, damn...
267 [interesting music]
268 Damn...
269 Damn
270 (Ji-won) [surprised] What should we do, I'm sorry, I'm sorry
271 Are you okay?
272 [embarrassed] I'm sorry
273 [frustrated sigh]
274 (Ji-won) Su-min, I'm sorry
275 I tripped over my own foot, didn't I?
276 [sigh]
277 [surprised] Honey
278 - Are you hurt anywhere? - (Min-hwan) Ugh, damn...
279 Oh, this is the shirt you cherished the most...
280 [sound of surprise]
281 (Ji-won) Oh no...
282 It's all ruined
283 What should we do
284 Napkin, napkin
285 Ah, napkin, uh, uh
286 (Ji-won) I won’t let this happen again
287 (Hee-yeon) Excuse me
288 Are you the one outside?
289 (Ji-won) Me?
290 (Hee-yeon) Yes, yes, yes
291 Are you perhaps the...
292 Can I ask a favor?
293 Do you need a sanitary pad by any chance?
294 (Hee-yeon) [surprised] Yes, yes, yes, yes
295 Yes, yes [Ji-won's faint laugh]
296 (Ji-won) Just a moment, I'll bring it to you
297 (Hee-yeon) Thank you, really, thank you.
298 Ah, I'm really so grateful.
299 I really wonder what kind of person I am.
300 I was going to treat you like a benefactor.
301 You were a close person after all.
302 I will make sure to treat you well.
303 Ah, treat you well? Of course, it's nothing.
304 Hee-yeon, just a moment.
305 (Ji-won) Excuse me.
306 As expected.
307 [dramatic music] [soft gasp]
308 [flapping sound effect]
309 [flapping sound effect]
310 (Ji-won) Okay.
311 How can you be so virtuous?
312 someone who I thought no longer existed in this era. 
313 The deputy manager is like the Good Samaritan
314 (Hee-yeon) The embodiment of our kind neighbor, who only existed in movies.
315 And truly, you are the light and salt of my life, a real benefactor.
316 [interesting music] [awkward laugh]
317 Ah, is this your natural personality?
318 (Hee-yeon) Oh my.
319 No, you're really so beautiful when you smile.
320 Why didn't I realize this until now?
321 You have both beauty and kindness.
322 You must really be living life on your own.
323 [laughter]
324 (Ji-won) Ah, you're really overdoing it.
325 I'm sure others would have done the same.
326 Ah, absolutely not.
327 Ah, before the deputy manager came in, someone else entered.
328 I was calling out so desperately, you know?
329 [Hee-yeon's dumbfounded laugh]
3330 (Hee-yeon) Grumbling and swearing,
331 then taking care of business and washing hands thoroughly before leaving.
332 [meaningful music]
333 (Soo-min) Thank you, thank you, my other half.
334 (Ji-won) Ah...
335 (Hee-yeon) Did you have a meal?
336 I haven't eaten yet.
337 I came here unprepared to eat,
338 I found myself in a crisis.
339 [calm music] Ah, that's right.
340 Now that I think about it, why haven't we had a meal together?
341 [slight laugh]
342 If it's okay with you, would you like to eat together?
343 (Soo-min) I was wondering why the person who went to get napkins hasn't come back.
344 I was wondering why they weren't coming back.
345 (Ji-won) Ah...
346 This side is also in an emergency situation.
347 What emergency?
348 (Soo-min) Well...
349 We handled it ourselves.
350 We took care of it well.
351 (Min-hwan) What's this?
352 (Ji-won) Park Min-hwan is going to be furious.
353 He begged me for a year to buy him that shirt.
354 (Soo-min) I’m really sorry, Deputy Manager Park.
355 I’ll buy you a shirt.
356 Ah, it's okay.
357 (Min-hwan) It’s just a shirt, nothing big.
358 Don’t worry about it.
359 (Hee-yeon) Isn’t this a designer brand?
360 Is it 1.5 million won, or is it 1.8 million won?
361 [slight laugh]
362 (Ji-won) It's not that much, maybe a little over 1.2 million won?
363 (Min-hwan) Well... (Soo-min) What should we do...
364 Since I'm a contract worker, I don’t have much money.
365 [interesting music] [slight laugh]
366 (Min-hwan) Ah, it's fine, don’t worry about it. Please eat.
367 Is it okay?
368 (Soo-min) As expected, Deputy Manager Park is capable.
369 - The best, the best - (Min-hwan) Soo-min, you too,
370 We should go buy a shirt together. [Min-hwan's laugh]
371 Eat, eat, eat. I have plenty of shirts at home.
372 Your heart is like the sea.
373 I was originally going to make stir-fried pork today.
374 Wow, it smells great, the scent of stir-fried pork.
375 [slight laugh]
376 (Soo-min) Deputy Manager Park is the best.
377 [cheerful music]
378 (Eun-ho) Always be careful with the fire.
379 Slice the onions a bit more.
380 Good, good, keep going.
381 Hey, it's burning.
382 If you leave it, it'll burn. Take a look again.
383 [Guests' applause]
384 Thank you for coming.
385 (Guest) The food is really delicious.
386 (Eun-ho) [smiling] Yes.
387 Chef Baek Eun-ho.
388 (Eun-ho) Yes.
389 You’re from Busan, right?
390 Yes, so what?
391 [interesting music]
392 (Min-hwan) Wow, Hee-yeon really eats well.
393 (Soo-min) True.
394 How can a woman eat so much?
395 [Hee-yeon's slight laugh]
396 Whether you're a woman or a man,
397 to do something big, you have to eat well.
398 (Hee-yeon) This is what my grandfather taught me.
399 (Soo-min) So? Did your grandfather do something big?
400 He sold bean sprouts.
401 Along with tofu and seasoning sauce.
402 Ah, he was in the side dish business.
403 Thanks to your grandfather, it seems like you have a lot of energy, Hee-yeon.
404 (Ji-won) Koreans' strength comes from rice, after all.
405 That's right, that's correct.
406 (Soo-min) Ah...
407 I have a small appetite, so it’s a big problem.
408 Ah, Soo-min, how are you going to work after eating that?
409 Soo-min, you can't eat much.
410 (Soo-min) True.
411 I should eat like Ji-won does.
412 [interesting music] Now that I think about it, our Ji-won,
413 has never had any problems with indigestion since she was young.
414 She had digestion power strong enough to chew through steel.
415 - Right, Ji-won? - (Ji-won) Yeah.
416 (Min-hwan) Ah, really? 
417 Now that I think about it, I remember when we used to have pig's feet soup back in the day.
418 You're totally an old man, an old man.
419 The roughness, ugh...
420 Old man.
421 [slight laugh]
422 Min-hwan, you shouldn't say that.
423 Our Ji-won should be loved unconditionally.
424 Love [slight laugh]
425 (Min-hwan) Ah, that's right, love is important.
426 It must be nice to have a friend like that, huh?
427 [Ji-won choking cough]
428 (Ji-won) Soo-min is like that, the best.
429 Why is it that men... [choking cough]
430 (Hee-yeon) Manager, I'll get you some water.
431 - Mine too, please. - Huh? Why me?
432 You're going to get water anyway.
433 - Ah, while I'm at it, mine too... - Anyway, Jeong Soo-min, who came to work at the company,
434 Could you do my work for me as well?
435 [interesting music]
436 (Soo-min) Me, me...
437 Me, me, me...
438 (Soo-min) Why is she acting like that, she’s so young, right?
439 Don’t do that.
440 [playful music]
441 It’s a company, after all.
442 You may be young, but your rank is the same as mine.
443 (Soo-min) Huh?
444 (Ji-won) Ah...
445 Still, I’ll try to talk to her properly.
446 (Min-hwan) Yeah, yeah, right? Talk to her for me, okay?
447 What kind of upbringing did she have, wrapping her manners up in seasoning sauce?
448 (Ji-won) Min-hwan, feed Soo-min and go up first.
449 You know she has a small appetite.
450 If you don’t take care of her, she won’t eat properly.
451 I’m so different from her.
452 Yeah, well...
453 (Ji-won) I’ll go up.
454 (Ji-won) Hee-yeon, I’m sorry.
455 I cleared the trays, it must have been really uncomfortable, right?
456 Ah, I’m sorry, I should have held back.
457 [sigh] [gulping sound]
458 I totally understood.
459 (Hee-yeon) The person who ignored me in the bathroom earlier,
460 is Jeong Soo-min.
461 [interesting music]
462 (Hee-yeon) Oh, excuse me, the person who just came in,
463 Could you possibly help me?
464 She’s unprepared herself, why does she want to ask others to help?
465 (Soo-min) [sighs] I cause so much trouble.
466 (Hee-yeon) Manager, would you like to go for coffee after our meeting?
467 - I’ll pay - (Ji-won) I said I’ll pay.
468 It seems Ji-won is upset.
469 I ruined the manager's shirt.
470 (Min-hwan) Oh, come on...
471 You know Ji-won’s not like that.
472 Earlier, she was even worried about Soo-min eating.
473 You know how much she cares, right?
474 (Soo-min) Really?
475 [sigh]
476 Ji-won can sometimes be too careless.
477 She doesn’t even know how much I like her.
478 (Min-hwan) Oh...
479 Even if she says it’s fine...
480 [elevator arrival sound]
481 (Employee 1) Let’s go. (Employee 2) Let’s go.
482 [employees are flustered]
483 (Min-hwan) Oh dear [Soo-min’s groan]
484 (Soo-min) Ah...
485 [significant music]
486 Oh, my hand...
487 (Min-hwan) Ah, ah, yes...
488 [Min-hwan clears his throat]
489 [interesting music] [Min-hwan’s shaky breath]
490 [soft groan]
491 (Soo-min) This...
492 What should we do?
493 (Min-hwan) Well, uh... [elevator arrival sound]
494 [soft laugh]
495 (Min-hwan) No, no, no, no, no, uh...
496 (Employee 3) We’ll go in now. (Employee 4) Hey, don’t push.
497 Don’t push, don’t push.
498 [employees murmuring]
499 [elevator doors closing]
500 (Soo-min) Perfume,
501 What kind do you use?
502 [sensual music]
503 (Min-hwan) Ah, this... yeah...
504 [Min-hwan’s heartbeat]
505 It smells nice.
506 Yeah, well...
507 [Min-hwan’s heartbeat]
508 (Min-hwan) Uh, uh...
509 (Ji-won) Thanks.
510 (Kyung-wook) Uh-huh.
511 Hey, what are you doing right now?
512 (Hee-yeon) Huh?
513 (Juran) Ah, here’s the meeting materials, Manager.
514 [laughter]
515 (Kyung-wook) Hey, didn’t I tell you not to do this?
516 Huh?
517 [sigh] Honestly, let me tell you,
518 The proposal you wrote is so obvious,
519 But if there’s even a small effort put into it,
520 The atmosphere of this meeting will be better!
521 Do you really think this makes sense?
522 - Huh? - (Ji-won) When a person is incompetent,
523 they focus on the little things they know and make a lot of noise about it.
524 (Soo-min) Ah, that looks unprofessional.
525 Hee-yeon, where’s the stapler?
526 Like this [interesting music]
527 At an angle.
528 The stapler?
529 (Kyung-wook) Right, huh?
530 Wow, Soo-min knows a thing or two.
531 [Soo-min’s soft laugh]
532 Just redo everything and staple it again.
533 [placing paper down]
534 (Juran) Do all of these?
535 (Hee-yeon) We’re going to waste so much paper.
536 Do you realize how many trees were used unnecessarily because of you?
537 It’s meant to make you feel guilty.
538 (Soo-min) Manager,
539 Juran, I’m sure you understand too.
540 Ji-won, can I have just one coffee with you?
541 Manager,
542 Can you just take a look at this proposal once?
543 I need to become a full-time employee, you know?
544 Should I go out and get some fresh air?
545 Should we?
546 [Soo-min’s soft laugh] [Kyung-wook clears throat]
547 I’m sorry, Manager.
548 I just didn’t know and stapled them straight.
549 [sigh] No, no.
550 It’s okay.
551 [Dramatic music]
552 (Ji-won) This definitely won’t do.
553 Assistant Manager Yang.
554 (Ji-won) Would you like to have a coffee with me?
555 (Joo-ran) Uh...
556 I have something the Manager asked me to do.
557 It’ll only take a moment.
558 (Joo-ran) Uh...
559 You're acting a bit strange.
560 (Joo-ran) Alright, next time, next time.
561 Ah, then at least look at this.
562 (Joo-ran) One-person household.
563 Isn't this the proposal the Manager rejected?
564 Ugh, what good would it do for me to look at this?
565 (Ji-won) Please read it properly.
566 If you really don't have time, then I can't do much about it.
567 Then.
568 (Joo-ran) Ah...
569 [Sound of hurried footsteps]
570 (Ji-won) [Surprised] You scared me!
571 Where did you run off to like that?
572 (Ji-won) Ah, well...
573 The meeting’s over, so I’m going to the bathroom and then...
574 (Ji-won) Let’s sneak away to the lounge for a bit.
575 (Ji-won) Ah...
576 (Ji-won) Oh, I was going to talk to Min-hwan, so...
577 You can go later.
578 [Somber music]
579 [Soft sigh]
580 [Heavy music]
581 [Sigh]
582 [Music: Crayon Pop 'Bar Bar Bar'] [Playful sound effect]
583 [Hye-yeon's savoring sound]
584 (Ji-won) Hye-yeon, I have to go to the office for something.
585 (Ji-won) I think I’ll need to go upstairs.
586 (Hye-yeon) Then do I eat all of this by myself?
587 [Hye-yeon’s joyful exclamation]
588 What should I do, I keep receiving all the time like this?
589 Then, would you go on a date with me this Sunday instead?
590 I’ll treat you to a meal.
591 Sunday?
592 (Soo-min) Instead, let’s go on a date this weekend.
593 I know a really delicious barbecue place called 'Gosuljeong.'
594 Ah, I don’t think I can on Sunday.
595 Do you have plans?
596 I do have plans,
597 but I don’t think I’ll go.
598 Ah, is it okay if I don’t go?
599 (Hee-yeon) What kind of plans do you have?
600 A reunion.
601 (Hee-yeon) If it’s a reunion, you should go.
602 You’ll see your first love,
603 get disappointed,
604 and then move on.
605 I wonder where my first love is and what they’re doing now.
606 No one knows where they are.
607 I was actually a pretty unpopular student.
608 Do I really have to go all the way there to confirm my embarrassing past?
609 (Hee-yeon) Doesn’t that mean you should go even more?
610 [Soft music] If you don’t go, it’ll just stay as an embarrassing past,
611 but if you go and change it, it’ll become history.
612 (Ji-Won) Ah, Manager 
613 (Ji-Hyuk) Yes 
614 (Ji-Won) About you asking if I’m free on Sunday 
615 If it’s urgent, I’ll come to work 
616 Didn’t you have plans? 
617 Well, yes, but 
618 It’s not important, and work comes first 
619 That seems right 
620 Kang Ji-Won comes first 
621 [calm music] 
622 (Ji-Won) Ah, well 
623 Actually, I’m debating whether to go or not 
624 Go 
625 When you’re unsure, the right answer depends on the situation 
626 But this time, give it a try 
627 It should be fine if you go 
628 Just remember you owe me one 
629 Huh? 
630 (Ji-Won) Read it properly 
631 But if you really don’t have time, it can’t be helped 
632 (Ju-Ran) It’s well written 
633 (Ji-Won) Assistant Yang 
634 Did you read it? 
635 (Ju-Ran) Yeah 
636 The proposal looks good 
637 That’s pretty good 
638 Would you like to try working on it together? 
639 (Ju-Ran) Ah... 
640 Work doesn’t always work like that 
641 The manager sees things differently from us... 
642 He didn’t even read it, that guy 
643 - What? - I read it 
644 [intriguing music] 
645 He pretended to flip through it 
646 He was just acting like he was reading 
647 (Ji-Won) This isn’t the first time 
648 He nitpicks every single thing of yours 
649 Just “No, no, no” all the time 
650 [Kyung-Wook clears his throat] 
651 (Kyung-Wook) That’s nothing new 
652 [baseball broadcast sounds from a phone] 
653 (Employee 5) Look at the manager, he’s causing a scene 
654 (Ji-Won) He thinks that’s what power is 
655 It’s ridiculous 
656 (Ji-Won) If you’ve been gaslighted for too long, you lose objectivity 
657 Just setting everything else aside 
658 Forget about the manager’s perspective or anything 
659 What’s your opinion? 
660 Do you really think my proposal is nonsense? Really? 
661 [soft sigh] 
662 Then I’ll try discussing it with the manager 
663 Manager Kim Kyung-Wook 
664 [dark music] 
665 [Kyung-Wook’s dramatic breathing] 
666 [Su-Min bites her nails] 
667 (Su-Min) That girl has been really annoying me lately 
668 (Kyung-Wook, Su-Min) Oh, you startled me! 
669 (Su-Min) Oh, Manager 
670 Did you enjoy your lunch? 
671 (Kyung-Wook) Our lovely Su-Min, huh? 
672 I had some loach soup to energize myself 
673 [Kyung-Wook’s laughter] [Su-Min’s awkward laughter] 
674 Oh, what about you, Su-Min? 
675 (Su-Min) Ah, I had stir-fried pork at the cafeteria 
676 (Kyung-Wook) Wow, that must’ve been delicious 
677 [Su-Min’s soft laughter] 
678 (Su-Min) Um... 
679 I have a little secret to share with you, Manager 
680 (Kyung-Wook) A secret? 
681 I need to become a permanent employee, right? 
682 (Su-Min) So, I’ve thought of something, but 
683 I can’t quite organize my thoughts 
684 (Kyung-Wook) Ah, I’ll help you organize them 
685 Really? 
686 Thank you so much 
687 (Kyung-Wook) Oh, come on 
688 With just a middle-aged lady who doesn’t even act like a woman and a bunch of nobodies, 
689 For the sake of improving this uninspired team atmosphere, 
690 Su-Min’s permanent employment is an urgent matter 
691 [Su-Min’s soft laughter] [Kyung-Wook’s laughter] 
692 [intriguing music] (Su-Min) Manager, you’re so... 
693 Funny and charming 
694 (Ji-Won) You know how he always works however he feels like 
695 That’s why he automatically opposes everything you say 
696 Ever since he got rejected after making a move on you back in the day 
697 [soft laughter] 
698 What is he saying? So childish 
699 (Ji-Won) He’s been repeating that childish behavior for 7 years, Kim Kyung-Wook has 
700 The only reason he could become a manager 
701 Was because he submitted your proposal under his name 
702 I know that 
703 (Ji-Won) Just like always, 
704 He used my proposal to make Jung Su-Min a permanent employee 
705 He was my mentor 
706 In this company, the work done by subordinates 
707 Always gets credited to their superiors... 
708 (Ji-Won) But you’ve never done that 
709 I’m really confident about this proposal 
710 And you know it’s a good one too 
711 [calm music] 
712 But the manager... 
713 I’ll resubmit the same proposal that got rejected on Monday 
714 Without even changing the title 
715 Huh? 
716 If it becomes clear that he rejected it without reading, 
717 Then, 
718 Will you stand with me? 
719 (Ji-Won) There’s a 100% chance he didn’t read it 
720 No, maybe 99%? 
721 I’m certain Kim Kyung-Wook doesn’t read proposals 
722 But if he remembers even one chart or figure... 
723 Don’t be scared, I’m right 
724 [laughter] 
725 Believe in how lazy and unproductive that man is 
726 [emphasizing sound effect] [tense music] 
727 [echoing footsteps] 
728 (Ji-Won) Manager, please review this 
729 It’s a new proposal 
730 [soft sigh] 
731 [tense sound effect] 
732 [escalating tense music] 
733 Are you messing with me right now? 
734 This is the same thing you gave me last time... 
735 [Kyung-Wook’s scoffing laugh] 
736 (Kyung-Wook) Wow, I’m absolutely speechless... 
737 This is... the same thing from last time... 
738 And it’s even worse! 
739 [ominous sound effect] [lively music] 
740 I mean, seriously? 
741 I’ve seen plenty of incompetent people in my life, 
742 But you’re the first of your kind 
743 How could you mess up this badly? 
744 It’s so obvious you just patched this together from here and there 
745 If you don’t want to work, just quit 
746 Why are you torturing me like this? 
747 I’m really sorry, Manager 
748 Was it the same as last time? 
749 (Ji-Won) I printed it again, just a moment 
750 Oh, here it is, the green one 
751 I’m so sorry, Manager. I apologize 
752 (Employee 6) What? He couldn’t recognize something he’s already seen? 
753 (Employee 7) Wow, he really doesn’t work at all 
754 (Employee 6) Ah, as expected, living up to his reputation 
755 [incredulous exhale] [soft gasp] 
756 [satisfying gasp] 
757 [satisfying gasp] 
758 I seriously thought, "No way, no way..." 
759 But how does he seriously not notice? 
760 The title is exactly the same. How can this happen? 
761 I told you he doesn’t work 
762 Now we’re all in the same team 
763 Meal kits are going to be a huge hit 
764 (Ji-Won) Quick and easy, delivering delicious meals to customers 
765 [Ju-Ran’s sigh] 
766 (Ju-Ran) Alright 
767 Now I understand why things haven’t been working out 
768 I finally get it 
769 Wow, seriously... 
770 I can’t believe I’ve been trusting someone like this all along 
771 [Hee-Yeon’s playful groan] 
772 (Hee-Yeon) Are you two having coffee by yourselves? 
773 Cheers [clinking glasses] 
774 (Hee-Yeon) Manager, this is incredible. How could you not know that? 
775 [dark music] 
776 (Su-Min) Meal kits for single-person households 
777 (Su-Min) Cheers [clinking glasses] 
778 (Kyung-Wook) What’s this? A date request after work? 
779 [Su-Min’s refreshing gasp] 
780 (Su-Min) Because of that secret I mentioned earlier today 
781 (Kyung-Wook) That word "secret"... 
782 It’s so exciting 
783 [Kyung-Wook’s laughter] 
784 Samgyeopsal (grilled pork belly) sounds good, right? Yeah? 
785 Oh, wait 
786 You said you had stir-fried pork for lunch earlier, didn’t you? 
787 Oh, this is two pork dishes in a row 
788 That might be a bit much, huh? 
789 Not at all 
790 I actually prefer Korean pork over Korean beef 
791 You’ve got good taste, huh? [pig squealing sound effect] 
792 (Kyung-Wook) As expected, our Su-Min is such an amazing woman 
793 Oh, please 
794 (Su-Min) The real amazing woman is Ji-Won 
795 [Kyung-Wook’s exasperated sigh] 
796 (Kyung-Wook) Ji-Won this, Ji-Won that 
797 Do you really like her that much? 
798 Women are impossible to understand.  
799 Ji-Won, though... [intriguing music]  
800 (Su-Min) She’s a bit different from us. She went to Korea University.  
801 She’s smart.  
802 And...  
803 She’s also pretty ambitious.  
804 (Kyung-Wook) Korea University? What’s so great about that?  
805 People from there just study all the time and end up being useless.  
806 Their proposals are always full of unrealistic, pie-in-the-sky nonsense.  
807 But Ji-Won probably doesn’t think that way, right?  
808 She probably thinks you’re "clueless" or "lack vision."  
809 That’s what she’d think, don’t you agree?  
810 [slams desk]  
811 Are you saying I lack vision?  
812 Oh, Su-Min, do you have a bit of a complex about your education?  
813 (Kyung-Wook) Don’t be like that, okay?  
814 College?  
815 It’s totally useless.  
816 I mean...  
817 Ideas can be good, sure. That’s the point, right?  
818 (Ji-won) Execution is separate, but  
819 Anyway, Kang Ji-won,  
820 (Kyung-wook) I always thought you were stiff,  
821 turns out you're the type to think like that behind the scenes, huh?  
822 Still, about that meal kit proposal you said was messed up earlier today,  
823 [angry breathing]  
824 It’s a mess, but the idea is good.  
825 If the manager brings it over  
826 and works on it with me,  
827 [clinking glasses]  
828 it might actually be a big hit, don’t you think?  
829 (Kyung-wook) With Sumin  
830 - together? - Yes.  
831 [faint laughter]  
832 Anyway, if Ji-won works on it, it’s just going to derail,  
833 but with your experience, Manager, if you steer it right,  
834 I feel like I might actually become a full-time employee.  
835 [awkward laughter]  
836 (Sumin) I guess I must feel really comfortable with you, Manager.  
837 I can even chat about work like I do with my brother.  
838 [Sumin’s faint laughter]  
839 (Kyung-wook) Did you just call me  
840 oppa (brother)?  
841 [playful music] [baby crying sound]  
842 [faint gasp]  
843 (Kyung-wook) Oh, of course, of course, uh,  
844 well, in private, I’m oppa, yeah.  
845 [Kyung-wook’s laughter]  
846 Now,  
847 come on, our Sumin,  
848 tell this oppa more about the proposal.  
849 [Kyung-wook laughing] First,  
850 (Sumin) Let’s toast again, though.  
851 (Kyung-wook) [laughing] Cheers!  
852 [satisfied exhale]  
853 [faint laughter]  
854 Manager oppa, eat some meat, eat some meat.  
855 (Sang-jong) Oh, nice shot.  
856 [Min-hwan’s angry breathing]  
857 (Min-hwan) Why does it have to be Kang Ji-won’s friend?  
858 He doesn’t even let me try anything.
859 (Sang-jong) Hey, hey, what does it matter?  
860 From the looks of it, she’s into you too, so just make a cool trade.  
861 A cool trade, seriously.  
862 (Min-hwan) What is this, a secondhand deal?  
863 This isn’t some psycho messing around, seriously.  
864 (Woman 1) Strike, right?  
865 (Woman 2) Wow, amazing.  
866 [Min-hwan’s cheering]  
867 (Min-hwan) Nice shot!  
868 Nice shot!  
869 [Min-hwan cheering loudly]  
870 Sang-jong,  
871 you don’t have any good girls on your radar? Huh?  
872 I’m going crazy, seriously.  
873 (Sang-jong) Crazy...  
874 Wow, it’s Friday, and you’re still so energetic.  
875 What about your girlfriend?  
876 Why bring her up and kill my vibe?  
877 Oh, she’s just for marriage.  
878 [incredulous laughter]  
879 Just for marriage?  
880 Look,  
881 she’s kind, frugal,  
882 takes care of her parents well,  
883 and she works hard but doesn’t know how to spend money.  
884 - What do you think? - (Sang-jong) Oh,  
885 sounds like the perfect wife material.  
886 Perfectly boring, though.  
887 (Min-hwan) She reads company prospect reports for fun, I’m telling you.  
888 Have you ever met someone like that?  
889 She’s probably looking at documents at work right now,  
890 like this.  
891 [calm music]  
892 (Ji-won) Starting over means you can do anything.  
893 It’s small, but I got back at Jung Su-min,  
894 and Kim Kyung-wook, too.  
895 You can do anything.  
896 [satisfied exhale]  
897 (Su-min) It’s a couple item.  
898 [intriguing music] Wear it when we meet on Sunday.  
899 Your eternal love, Su-min.  
900 Did you see the earrings she wore?  
901 [phone vibrating sound]  
902 (Su-min)  
903 [ominous sound effect]  
904 Ko Seol-jeong.  
905 It’s certain.  
906 [people murmuring]  
907 [phone dialing tone]  
908 [shoulders bumping lightly]  
909 [incredulous laughter]  
910 (Ye-ji) She’s really not coming, is she?  
911 (Su-min) Ji-won-ah,  
912 Ji-won, are you here? Are you here?  
913 Come on in, let’s go.  
914 (Ji-won) What is this?  
915 Weren’t you two eating together?  
916 (Su-min) If I said it was a reunion, you wouldn’t have come.  
917 We’re over thirty now.  
918 Let’s forget the past.  
919 You know they’re all good friends, right?  
920 - Let’s go. - (Ji-won) Su... Su-min, I...  
921 (Su-min) It’s okay.  
922 (Ji-won)  
923 (Ye-ji) Kang Ji-won, seriously impressive.  
924 Where does she think she has a close enough friend to come here?  
925 (Friend 1) Maybe she came to eat some meat.  
926 From the look of it, she must not eat well on her own.  
927 (Ye-ji) Why are you suddenly speaking in Seoul dialect? Creepy.  
928 (Friend 2) But still, how does she stick to Su-min like that?  
929 (Ye-ji) Isn’t it obvious?  
930 Su-min, that softie,  
931 probably thinks being nice is the best policy, that’s why.  
932 Without Su-min, she wouldn’t even be able to eat meat.  
933 [ominous music]  
934 Drink some milk.  
935 [girls laughing]  
936 Stop it.  
937 [girls laughing]  
938 Our Jung Su-min is too nice, it’s really a problem.  
939 (Ye-ji) We should take care of her ourselves.  
940 Did you see those earrings she wore?  
941 Looks like she copied Su-min’s.  
942 Even from 500 meters away, it’s obviously fake, isn’t it?  
943 Kang Ji-won has been clinging to Su-min since high school...  
944 (Friend 2) Ye-ji, wait a second.  
945 (Ye-ji) Huh?  
946 (Friend 2) Kang Ji-won wasn’t at her seat earlier.  
947 [tense music]  
948 [bang, something kicked] [surprised reaction]  
949 [bang, something kicked]  
950 [bang, something kicked]  
951 (Ye-ji) What, she was here?  
952 [incredulous laughter]  
953 Why is she pretending not to be here?  
954 Wow...  
955 That girl is seriously sneaky!  
956 [sigh]  
957 Are you crazy? Why would I go there?  
958 (Ji-won)  
959 [phone vibrating sound]  
960 (Su-min)  
961 [incredulous laughter]  
962 Do they think my house is some kind of motel?  
963 (Ji-won) The two of them...  
964 Wait a second.  
965 [intriguing music] [ominous sound effect]  
966 Yeah.  
967 Why wait for what’s bound to happen?  
968 Their undying love for each other,  
969 I’ll help make it happen faster.  
970 Assistant Manager Kang, let’s head this way.  
971 (Ji-won) Thank you.  
972 [card key recognition sound]  
973 (Ji-hyuk) Are you leaving work now?  
974 (Ji-won) Yes, are you just coming in, Manager?  
975 I had some things to organize.  
976 Good work today. I’ll be on my way then...  
977 (Ji-hyuk) Oh, wait.  
978 (Ji-won) This?  
979 I got it as a gift.  
980 (Ji-hyuk) That...  
981 There’s an authentic one of those.  
982 Someone who knows will recognize it.  
983 [calm music]  
984 [ominous sound effect]  
985 That...  
986 There’s an authentic one of those.  
987 Someone who knows will recognize it.  
988 I mean...  
989 I think...  
990 You probably shouldn’t use it.  
991 You probably shouldn’t use it.  
992 (Ji-won) I remember now.  
993 You said something similar before, and I thought it was rude.  
994 Back then, I didn’t know what I’d face at the reunion.  
995 It’s a gift from a friend,  
996 but I thought you were just saying something negative.  
997 I’m sorry.  
998 Actually, no.  
999 Thank you.  
1000 Do you need a ride?  
1001 What?  
1002 Oh, since it’s late.  
1003 No, it’s fine.  
1004 The bus is still running, and I’ll get home quickly.  
1005 I’d like to give you a ride.  
1006 I’ll have to decline.  
1007 I have plans with my boyfriend.  
1008 (Ji-won) Then, I’ll be going.  
1009 (Min-hwan) Thank you. Keep the change.  
1010 [phone vibrating] What’s this?  
1011 You’re running over here right after overtime?  
1012 Well, he’s human too, he must be starving.  
1013 This is chaos, absolute chaos.  
1014 Kang Ji-won, you’re done for today.  
1015 [intriguing music] [emphasizing sound effect]  
1016 If I drink this, I’ll get totally wasted, right?  
1017 [store bell rings]  
1018 (Su-min)  
1019 [playful sound effect]  
1020 [sigh]  
1021 [phone vibrating]  
1022 (Su-min) Ugh...  
1023 "Hurry up and come"?  
1024 No emoticons, just coldly...  
1025 This is really too much.  
1026 I'm not going.  
1027 I'm not going!  
1028 [door lock sound] [shower sound]  
1029 (Min-hwan) ♪ You turn my heart upside down,  
1030 Upside down, upside down ♪  
1031 Roar!  
1032 [intriguing music] [straining groan]  
1033 Ji-won, you're done for today.  
1034 (Ji-won) Why did you come so quickly?  
1035 [phone vibrating sound]  
1036 (Su-min) I'm not going, I'm upset, I’m going home, hmph.  
1037 I'm a little hurt.  
1038 What’s this? Why aren’t you coming?  
1039 [suspenseful sound effect]  
1040 [door opening sound] [Ji-won’s surprised breath]  
1041 [flustered breath]  
1042 [emphasizing sound effect]  
1043 Did you come?  
1044 [flustered breath]  
1045 You came quickly.  
1046 I thought it would take longer.  
1047 I came to spend the night with you.
1048 I took a taxi to get here.  
1049 [flustered breath]  
1050 Really?  
1051 (Min-hwan) It's been  
1052 so long.  
1053 It's been a while.  
1054 Right?  
1055 [awkward laughter]  
1056 Yeah, it’s really been a while.  
1057 (Ji-won) So, about that… can we talk—  
1058 (Min-hwan) We should talk.  
1059 Talk with our bodies.  
1060 Maybe we should, uh, get dressed first...  
1061 (Min-hwan) Shh!  
1062 Right now,  
1063 for us,  
1064 clothes  
1065 are unnecessary.  
1066 [horrified scream]  
1067 (Min-hwan) Come here.  
1068 Stay right there.  
1069 [soft gasp]  
1070 [horrified scream]  
1071 [calm music]  
1072 You look great, beautiful, really beautiful.  
1073 (Ji-won) Turning a dark past into history...  
1074 Especially for someone like me, it doesn’t change overnight.  
1075 Actually, I was bullied.  
1076 (Ye-ji) Just a little slip-up and you forget how much of a loser you were, huh?  
1077 (Su-min) I’m really glad I met Manager Park.  
1078 (Ji-won) Already here? Right behind you.  
1079 (Eun-ho) I used to like you.  
1080 Do you have someone you like?  
1081 (Han-il) Find out who’s making him act like this.  
1082 Figure it out.
